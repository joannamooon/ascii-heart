Created at the end of my 1B term @ UWaterloo. 

I learned linear algebra this term, and my favorite part about the course was transformations. I took inspo from the infamous spinning donut, but wanted to make a heart ðŸ’–. I'm finally satsified by actually being able to understand the math behind the rotations.
